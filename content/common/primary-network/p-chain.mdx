In the Avalanche Network, the P-Chain of the Primary Network is responsible for all validator and Subnet-level operations. The P-Chain supports the creation of new blockchains and Subnets, the addition of validators to Subnets, staking operations, and other platform-level operations.

Each Avalanche validator can register a BLS public key alongside its NodeID on the Avalanche P-Chain. Validators of Subnets can stake different amounts of the Subnet's staking token. Through the P-Chain, we can determine a weighted set of BLS Public Keys that correspond to the validators of each Subnet on the Avalanche Network.

Anyone can see on the P-Chain the current weighted validator sets of every Subnet and how the set has evolved over time.
