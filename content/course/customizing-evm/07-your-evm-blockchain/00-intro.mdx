In this part of our course, we'll look at running your own Avalanche Network with your own EVM. The ability to run your own EVM enables us to cater to specific use cases and is one of the key advantages of multi-chain systems over monolithic systems.

## Hands-On Exercise

In this section, we do not need to write a single line of Go code. We simply run some commands to spin up our EVM blockchain.

## Structure of this Section

We will cover the following topics in this section:

- Avalanche Network Runner: This tool enables us to spin up our own Avalanche Network and add Subnets and Blockchains to it.
- Connecting Core: Learn how to connect Core to a blockchain running on your own Avalanche Network.

This practical exercise will let you consolidate your learnings and appreciate the impact of customizations on EVM performance first-hand.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this section, you will have the skills to run your own Avalanche Network with your own EVM blockchain effectively, opening new doors for your blockchain projects.
