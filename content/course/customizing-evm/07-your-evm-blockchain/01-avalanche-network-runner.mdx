## What is the Avalanche Network Runner?

The Avalanche Network Runner (ANR) is a tool to run and interact with a local Avalanche network. Recall that an Avalanche network is a collection of nodes using the Avalanche consensus mechanism to come to agreement on the blockchains of the Primary Network and Subnets.

Each Avalanche network has its own Primary Network, which comes with a Contract (C), Platform (P), and Exchange (X) chain. Note, however, that the naming "Primary Network" isn't actually very accurate, since it's a special Subnet, not its own network. 

Your local network is completely independent from the Mainnet or Fuji Testnet. You can even run your own Avalanche Network without being connected to the internet. Any local Avalanche network supports (but is not limited to) the following commands:

- Start and stop a network: Starts and stops a local network with a specified number of nodes
- Add, remove and stop a node: Give control to change the set of nodes of the network 
- Health Check: Provide information on the health of each node of the network
- Save and Load Snapshots: Save the current state of each node into a snapshot
- Create Subnets: Create a new Subnet validated by a specified subset of the nodes
- Create Blockchains: Create a new Blockchain as part of a new or existing Subnet

When we start a network, create a new Subnet, or add a blockchain to a Subnet, we will need to communicate with all involved nodes. Since our local network may consist of many nodes, this can take a lot of effort.

To make managing the local Avalanche network easier, the Avalanche Network Runner introduces a gRPC server that manages nodes for us. We can tell the gRPC what to do, an example being to create a new Subnet, and it will coordinate the nodes accordingly. This way, we can interact with one gRPC Server instead of managing all five nodes individually.

## Difference Between Avalanche CLI and Avalanche Network Runner

The Avalanche CLI you may know from previous courses focuses more on Subnet than Avalanche Networks. It manages Subnets that may be part of the Avalanche Mainnet, Testnet, or a local network. For the local network, Avalanche CLI is actually using the Avalanche Network Runner.

## Usage

There are two ways you can interact with the Avalanche Network Runner:

- Command Line: Commands can be issued using the command line, e.g. `avalanche-network-runner control stop`
- HTTP: You can also send commands as HTTP Post requests to the Avalanche Network Runner

While the command line is handy for short commands (e.g. stopping the network), issuing more complex commands with more data, like adding a blockchain, can be hard from the command line. We recommend using the HTTP endpoints for that. Both ways can be combined.
