## Avalanche

This course is intended for people with a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

1. Virtual Machines: What they are and what VM customization means
2. Blockchains: What the difference between a VM, Blockchain, and a Subnet is

If some of this is not clear, I strongly recommend taking the Avalanche Fundamentals and Subnet Architecture courses first.

## Software Development

You will need a general understanding of Software Development. You won't have to write a lot of code, but you will have to be able to understand some. Therefore, we recommend:

1. Solidity: Basic Knowledge, familiarity with types and interfaces. Familiarity with Hardhat will help in advanced sections. 
2. Go: You don't necessarily need to know Go, but should have some experience with an advanced object-oriented and typed language (C, C++, Java, TS)
3. Testing: It will help you in later sections if you are generally familiar with the concept of unit testing
