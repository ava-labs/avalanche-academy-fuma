To interact with your customized EVM we need a wallet and an account. To do that, we will use Core. Core is an all-in-one command center built for multi-chain systems. It supports Avalanche, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all EVM-compatible blockchains. Core has a browser extension, a web wallet, and a mobile app. It is optimized for multiple chains and makes navigating between them easy.

## Install Core Browser Extension

Core extension is compatible with Google Chrome and the Brave Browser. Head to the chrome web Store and add it to your browser: [Core Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/core-crypto-wallet-nft-ex/agoakfejjabomempkjlepdflaleeobhb)

After installation, make sure you pin the extension, since we will use it a lot in this course.

## Adding a Test Account

Throughout this course we will use an account with a publicly know private key. The address 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC is commonly used in local Virtual Machine Development for testing purposes. 

<Callout title="Warning" type="warn">
Never use this address or its private key for anything but testing on a local test network. The private key is publicly known and any real funds transferred to the associated address will most likely be stolen.
</Callout>

In order to use this account, import it to the Core browser extension. Click on the small arrow next to the account at the top and then change to the Imported tab.

The private key for this address is: `56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027`

To make sure we don't confuse this account with another account, let's rename it:
