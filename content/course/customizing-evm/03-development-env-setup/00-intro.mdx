It's time to set up the development environment required for us to develop customizing the EVM! Although teaching you about precompiles is the foremost objective of this course, we also want you to be able to configure a development environment that is instrumental to achieving a smooth and efficient workflow. 

In this section, we will go over the following:

- Creating a GitHub repository for our customized EVM
- Setting up a default test account in your Core Wallet
- Learning about the different types of development setups available
- Deciding the setup to use for developing precompiles

Let's get started! ðŸš€
