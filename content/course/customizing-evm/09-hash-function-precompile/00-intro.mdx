## What We're Building

In this section, we'll create a precompile for the hash function md5. Since there's a Go library for this hash function, we can avoid reimplementing the algorithm in Solidity and make use of the better efficiency of Go over Solidity.

<Accordion title="What is a Hash Function?">

A hash function is a special type of function that takes input data of any size (a letter, a word, the text of a book, all combined texts available on the internet, ...) and converts it into a fixed-size output. This output, called a hash value, represents the original data. The process is often referred to as "hashing."

Hash functions have a few properties:

- **Deterministic**: Given the same input, a hash function will always produce the same output. If you hash the word "apple" a thousand times, you'll get the same hash value each time.
- **Fixed Size**: No matter the size of the input data, whether it's a single character or an entire novel, the hash function always produces an output (the hash value) of the same length.
- **Fast Computation**: Hash functions are designed to be quick and efficient, returning a hash value with minimal computational resources and time.
- **Preimage Resistance**: It's computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input data if you only have the hash value. This property is especially important in cryptographic hash functions, where it helps to secure data.
- **Avalanche Effect**: A small change to the input should produce such drastic changes in output that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value. If you hash "apple" and "Apple", the resulting hash values should look completely different.
- **Collision Resistance**: It's very unlikely that two different pieces of input data will result in the same hash value. However, due to the limited length of hash values, this is theoretically possible in a scenario called a "collision." Good hash functions make these collisions exceedingly rare.

Hash functions are used in various applications in computer science, such as data retrieval, data integrity verification, password storage, and in blockchain technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

## Reference Implementation

To help you understand how precompiles are built, we'll compare each step with a reference example: A precompile for the sha256 hash function. Both precompiles are very similar and just have a single function, which returns the hashed value.

## Overview of Steps

Here's an overview of the steps:

1. Create a Solidity interface for the precompile
2. Generate the ABI
3. Write the precompile code in Go
4. Configure and register the precompile
5. Build and run your customized EVM
6. Connect Remix to your customized EVM and interact with the precompile
