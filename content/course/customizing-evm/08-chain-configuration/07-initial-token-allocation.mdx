## Background

Alloc defines the initial balances of addresses at the time of the chain creation. This should be changed accordingly for each chain.

If you don't provide any genesis allocation, you won't be able to interact with your new chain, since all transactions require a fee to be paid from the sender's balance. If there is no initial allocation, there are no funds to pay for any transactions

## Format

The alloc field expects key-value pairs. Keys of each entry must be a valid address. The balance field in the value can be either a hexadecimal or number to indicate initial balance of the address. 

```json
{
  "config": {
    // ...
  },
  "alloc": {
    "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
      "balance": "0x295BE96E64066972000000"
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

The keys in the allocation are hex addresses without the canonical 0x prefix. The balances are denominated in Wei (10^18 Wei = 1 Whole Unit of the native token of the chain) and expressed as hex strings with the canonical 0x prefix. You can use this converter to translate between decimal and hex numbers: [RapidTables Number to HEX](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html)

The default configuration for testing purposes contains configures plenty of tokens to a the address `8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC`. The private key for this address is: `56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027`

<Callout title="Warning" type="warn">
Never use the address or the private key for anything but testing on a local test network. The private key is publicly known and any real funds transferred to the associated address are most likely going to be stolen.
</Callout>

## Configure

Allocate tokens to two addresses:

1. The well-known test address `8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC`
2. Another test address you have created (do not use an address you use for real funds)

### Example Code

```json
{
  "config": {
    // ...
  },
  "alloc": {
    "8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC": {
      "balance": "0x295BE96E64066972000000"
    },
    "<your_address>": {
      "balance": "0x295BE96E64066972000000"
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```
